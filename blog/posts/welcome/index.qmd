This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

<!-- ![](thumbnail.jpg) -->

I've set it up with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (of course), an [AWS S3 bucket for static site hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html),
and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for rendering and updating the contents of the S3 bucket.

The blog is in pretty rough shape right now.

Some things that need to be done are,

- [x] setting up ssl certs for https
- [x] style
- [ ] write some posts
- [ ] set up plugins/integrations for commenting
- [ ] set up plugins/integrations for rss
- [ ] link some social media
