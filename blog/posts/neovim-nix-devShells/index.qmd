<!-- Nix users can create virtual environments with the [pkgs.mkShell](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-mkShell) -->
<!-- function. On flake based systems, this virtual environment is declared in a -->
<!-- `flake.nix` file and activated with the command `nix develop`. While the virtual -->
<!-- environment is activated, the packages declared in `packages` attribute of the -->
<!-- set passed to `pkgs.MkShell` are available to the user. -->

The nix-shell allows user to decalare reproducible development enviornments with the
[pkgs.mkShell](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-mkShell) function.
With flakes, this function which takes an attribute-set, can be added to a `flake.nix` file
and actived with the command `nix develop`.
